                        <p>
                            In the modern day, Deanwood might be called a “food desert,” a
                            low-income census tract where a substantial number of residents have
                            low access to a supermarket or large grocery store, as defined by the
                            Economic Research Service (ERS) in 2011. As of 2017, there are only two
                            full-service grocery stores in Ward 7, the ward of DC that contains
                            Deanwood, for a population of 80,000 people. But such a bleak statistic
                            is not without history. Ashante Reese, in her book Black Food
                            Geographies, points out that literature on the topic of food scarcity
                            (involving racial biases or not) tends to frame “lack” as a terminal
                            issue without struggle. These texts often paint a desolate picture of
                            access and inaction for communities like Deanwood but fail to document
                            how residents adapt and create their own opportunities in response.
                            Deanwood has a rich history, particularly in the area of food, and with
                            this project, we hope to illuminate how Deanwood residents sustained
                            themselves even with a lack of outside support.

                                own food in the 20th century United States. Taking the Deanwood
                                neighborhood in Washington, D.C. as their starting place, students
                                consulted newspaper articles and census data to design an
                                interactive

                                how access to food for residents in Deanwood has changed over time
                                from
                                the early 1900s to the present day.

                                <p>
                                    Throughout the 1900s, Deanwood received less government
                                    investment and
                                    benefits compared to similar-sized White neighborhoods in DC,
                                    such as
                                    Kenilworth. However, the ways in which the residents of Deanwood
                                    adapted
                                    helped the neighborhood develop a healthy, self-sustaining
                                    economy.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In particular, Deanwood practiced self-sufficiency in goods and
                                    services
                                    related to food. Most of the food-related businesses in Deanwood
                                    were
                                    community-based, and the food largely came from small,
                                    family-owned
                                    businesses that sourced and sold locally. This type of business
                                    environment circulated money, jobs, and resources within the
                                    community
                                    and helped strengthen community relations.

                                    Oral histories from 1975 of Deanwood residents shed more light
                                    on how
                                    this self-sufficiency came about. Many residents who were
                                    interviewed
                                    for the Anacostia Oral History Project discussed how their
                                    families grew
                                    most of their own food and sold the surplus in neighborhood
                                    markets and
                                    mom and pop stores. One resident, Anita Blake, said, “[Our
                                    family] grew
                                    all our own vegetables.” Since her uncle owned a drug store,
                                    their
                                    surplus was sold there. Another resident Ethel Greene, mentioned
                                    how her
                                    mother was interested in merchandising, so they “had stands in
                                    the Old
                                    Market where we sold honey and flowers, fruits and vegetables.”

                                    In this period, Deanwood was ripe with local entrepreneurs whose
                                    businesses were integral parts of the community, just as they
                                    were
                                    individually a part of the local community. For example,
                                    Certified Market
                                    was a family-owned business in Deanwood in the 1940s that went
                                    on to
                                    become a successful chain store called Murry’s Steak.

                                <p>
                                    But Deanwood, despite the community’s relative self-sufficiency,
                                    was not
                                    exempt from greater societal trends–namely, the phenomenon of
                                    the
                                    supermarket. Starting from the 1930s and continuing into the
                                    modern day,
                                    chain stores like Kroger and Safeway have become a dominant
                                    force in
                                    American food for most urban and suburban citizens. Shoppers
                                    liked chain
                                    stores for their convenience, variety, and perceived modernity,
                                    which
                                    combined plainly outcompeted local purveyors such as hucksters
                                    (street
                                    vendors). The cost of this switch, however, was the social
                                    relationships
                                    formed through such communal activities.

                                    The transition to chain grocery stores was not smooth for
                                    Deanwood, a community largely knit together by “businesses ran
                                    by and for the community.” In general, these chain stores were
                                    not friendly to black employment. The New Negro Alliance, a
                                    D.C.-based
                                    employment justice organization for middle-class blacks in the
                                    1900s,
                                    boycotted and picketed a number of Safeway Inc.’s stores for
                                    discriminatory
                                    hiring practices. Their efforts culminated in the landmark case
                                    New Negro
                                    Alliance v. Sanitary Grocery Co., 303 U.S. 552, which safeguards
                                    the
                                    right to peacefully protest hiring discrimination.

                                    For Deanwood, in one instance, the entrance of a Safeway “cut

                                    local food vendors business, according to Allison, a 68-year old

                                    But residents complained about discrimination in the store which
                                    neglected to hire black workers despite serving a nearly
                                    all-black
                                    clientele. After mass complaint and food quality concerns, the

                                    closed in 1980.

                                    lot. Built in 1981, Super Pride prided itself on its “soul food”
                                    and
                                    close community ties while still retaining a modern supermarket
                                    feel.
                                    According to Edward Brown, general manager in 1983, it was “not

                                    about black food retailers.” However, the location closed within

                                    Barry Scher, a spokesman for Giant Food Inc., a large chain
                                    grocery
                                    store company at the time, called Super Pride stores “small and
                                    antiquated.” The transition towards cultural and economic
                                    dependency on
                                    supermarkets had well finished by this time, and the resources
                                    of
                                    large, nationwide corporations were outstripping local grocers.

                                <p>
                                    And yet, though this social expectation was catching on, the
                                    physical
                                    stores did not follow. Following the turmoil around the former
                                    Safeway
                                    and then Super Pride’s closure, chain grocery stores tended to
                                    avoid
                                    or leave Deanwood. From 2010 to 2017, the number of full-service
                                    grocery
                                    stores in Ward 7 (which contains Deanwood) fell from four to two
                                    for a
                                    population of 80.000 people.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    So we return to Deanwood’s classification as a “food desert.”
                                    But as
                                    Ashante Reese points out, such a simplified term “overemphasizes
                                    lack
                                    and very rarely examines agency or resilience among community
                                    members.”
                                    It brings to mind images of barren emptiness and removes the
                                    nuance of
                                    neighborhood response as well as non-supermarket adjacent food
                                    sources.
                                </p>

                                    However, as in the past the residents of Deanwood adapt to their
                                    conditions. The grocery store closest to Deanwood, a new
                                    Safeway, is
                                    described by residents as “dirty,” “dangerous,” “poorly
                                    stocked,” and
                                    of “last resort.” Those who have easy access to transportation
                                    prefer
                                    to visit further stores, expanding their own food geographies,
                                    and those
                                    who don’t carpool or source food in bulk. Churches and other
                                    community
                                    organizations organize food programs. Residents actively weigh
                                    cost,
                                    distance, desire, and safety to achieve patterns of life that
                                    are
                                    healthy and well-informed, even if it requires more deliberation
                                    than
                                    it might living with better access.
