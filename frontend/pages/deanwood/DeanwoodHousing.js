                        Deanwood is “a historically stable, self-reliant, self-sufficient and
                        close-knit primarily African-American community” (Bissinger 2007). The city
                        has been described as “a place where store owners know their customers by
                        name, where residents spend their evenings sitting on porches and where
                        churchgoers fill the streets Sunday mornings on their way to one of the
                        community's more than 20 churches” (Washington Post, 1988).

                            Typically, it was very difficult for African Americans to obtain home
                            loans since predominantly black districts were generally redlined.
                            Families living in the “red zone” did not qualify for government-backed
                            loans, and, thus, were unable to receive aid to purchase a home.
                            However, Deanwood provided homeownership opportunities for
                            African-Americans in Washington, where homes were sold and paid in
                            monthly installments. Many of the homes stayed in the family of the
                            original owners’ for several generations. This can be inferred through
                            the repeated $10 dollar transfers found in the Washington Record of
                            Deeds, signifying that homes’ ownership was passed down from parents to
                            their children. By keeping the home in the family, people saved on fees
                            normally associated with purchasing and selling homes such as realtor
                            fees. Although some still remain in the original families, with a recent
                            wave of gentrification in the neighborhood, more families have been
                            forced to sell their homes at lower prices than comparable communities.
                            Consequently, these families lose one of their biggest assets—their
                            home.

                        <h2>The Issue of Gentrification </h2>
                        <p>
                            With the recent rise in property values, and consequently property
                            taxes, it may not be feasible for many low-income residents to afford to
                            pay their property taxes and for low-income, minority buyers to purchase
                            a home. Responding to these gentrification pressures, a Georgetown
                            report proposes classifying Deanwood as a historical district, stressing
                            the importance of both preserving the homes in the owners’ family line
                            and maintaining affordable prices.

                        <h2>Comparison between Deanwood and Brightwood </h2>
                        <p>
                            Despite the rise in housing prices, Deanwood homes perform noticeably
                            worse than nearby communities in the housing market. We compared
                            Deanwood to Brightwood, a predominantly white neighborhood with houses
                            of comparable size and style, on the other side of the city.
                            Historically, houses in both neighborhoods remained in the family across
                            generations. However, when houses were sold, Brightwood’s selling price
                            was significantly higher than that Deanwood’s, with a median home value
                            of $665,000 compared to Deanwood’s $391,740. This signifies a 70%
                            difference in the price of houses of comparable sizes. Despite the high
                            selling value of Brightwood properties, the homes remain in the family,
                            meaning that owners are able to afford their taxes and the neighborhood
                            is not being gentrified.
