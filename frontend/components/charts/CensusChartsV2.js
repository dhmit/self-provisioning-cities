                    <p>
                        Starting in the early 20th century the Great Migration saw six million
                        African Americans move into northern and western cities. One such popular
                        destination was Washington DC. During this time the population of DC
                        increased and especially the African American population. About 57,000
                        Black people moved into the District of Columbia between 1950-1960. Many
                        African Americans lived in alley houses which were small dwellings that
                        were made in the back alleys of DC. In the 1930s, alley houses in
                        neighborhoods that became predominantly white were cleaned for “urban
                        sanitation.” One suspicion is that the goal of this process was to remove
                        African Americans from previously integrated neighborhoods. As African
                        American residents were forced to move, one of their only options was to
                        relocate to Deanwood.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        The number of acres of land that African Americans lived on in DC stayed
                        the same while the population of African Americans increased. We see above
                        that Tract 78 saw the median number of people in a household rise from 3
                        to between 5 and 7 in 1950, but then shifted back to 2 people in 1960.
                        However, in 1960 density rose again, and there are significantly more
                        than 5+ people per household, more than ever before.

                    {
                        this.state.rent.map((each,i) =>
                            <BarChart data={each} key={i +"rent"}/>)
                    }
                    <p>
                        As the population of African Americans increased while the available acres
                        and housing stayed the same, prices went up. Tract 78 faced a higher
                        demand for housing with the same amount of supply increasing rent costs.
                        In 1940 the median rent was $30-$39. 1950 saw a bimodal distribution
                        where the rents of $40-49 and $60-74 were the most popular rents. This
                        could suggest two different lifestyles in Deanwood during this time period
                        where one side of Deanwood responded quickly to population growth by
                        increasing rent while the other side of Deanwood remained relatively
                        similar to the previous decade in terms of rent. In the 1960s the median
                        rent was $70-79 dollars. This was much higher than in previous decades,
                        possibly from the greater density of people in households which at the
                        time the majority of households had 4+ people.

                        Median Housing Value in 1940 was $4k-5k. Median Housing Value in 1950 was
                        $10k-15k. Median Housing Value in 1960 was $10k-12.5k. The median household
                        value stayed about the same but there were a lot more houses above the
                        median.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        In 1960, a study of “Negro Housing in DC” found that African American
                        populations could afford to buy houses with their incomes,  but they
                        weren’t allowed to buy in the suburbs, which had most of the new housing
                        but were only White buyers could get loans. Meanwhile, the crowding
                        problem only got worse. This reinforces the fact that economic
                        disadvantage is one factor contributing to Washington's housing patterns,
                        but it is not the major factor responsible for these patterns.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Through careful analysis of the context of DC during these time periods,
                        we see that the movement of African American populations to DC most likely
                        caused the government of DC to relocate African Americans from the city of
                        DC into Deanwood which was racially motivated. This overpopulated Deanwood
                        with both rich and poor African Americans in low-quality housing. This
                        overpopulation led to a decreased supply of housing which led to a
                        decreased quality of life, increased rent prices, and increased housing
                        prices that negatively impacted the entire Deanwood population and African
                        American population of DC for decades to come.
